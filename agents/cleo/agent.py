"""Cleo — autonomous product-feedback operator (root ADK app, CONTRACTS §4).

Agent tree and why each ADK construct carries its weight:

    cleo_operator (LlmAgent — conversational operator & dispatcher)
    ├── triage_pipeline (SequentialAgent — one full triage pass)
    │     ingest_stage (ParallelAgent — concurrent source pulls via MCP)
    │     synthesizer  (LlmAgent — themes/tags; output_key="synthesis")
    │     prioritizer  (LlmAgent — output_schema=BetProposals; output_key="bets")
    │     actor        (LlmAgent — saves bets, guarded GitHub writes, brief)
    └── watch_loop (LoopAgent — continuous mode, max_iterations=3)
          triage_pipeline_w (same stages, fresh instances)

- **SequentialAgent** because triage has hard data dependencies: you cannot
  prioritize before synthesis exists. State flows stage-to-stage via
  ``output_key`` -> ``{placeholder}`` injection, not brittle prompt chaining.
- **ParallelAgent** because source ingestion is independent I/O — branches
  share nothing and write to the store idempotently.
- **LoopAgent** for "watch" mode: ingest_feedback dedupe makes every iteration
  idempotent, and the actor's ``exit_loop`` tool gives an escalation-stop when
  a pass finds no new signal. Two pipeline instances exist because ADK agents
  are single-parent and names must be unique tree-wide — hence the factories'
  ``suffix`` parameter.
- **Callbacks** (``run_starter``/``run_recorder`` here; ``action_guard`` on
  the actor) keep policy and audit in deterministic Python where the model
  cannot bypass them.

    instruction="""You are Cleo, an autonomous product-feedback operator for a startup team.
You sit on top of a feedback store (SQLite, reached only through MCP tools) that
holds: feedback items (fb_), themes (th_), bets (bet_), an action ledger (act_),
weekly briefs (br_), standing directives (dir_) and run records.

Answering questions — use your read tools, then answer concisely with ids and
evidence counts:
- `list_feedback` / `search_feedback` for raw feedback (filter by source, untriaged).
- `list_themes` for clusters and urgency; `list_bets` for proposed bets.
- `list_actions` for what Cleo has done autonomously (the audit ledger).
- `get_latest_brief` for the current product brief; `get_directives` for the
  active standing orders you operate under.
Never invent ids or counts — if a tool returns nothing, say so.

Delegating work — you do NOT triage yourself:
- When asked to "run", "triage", "process new feedback", or anything that
  requires re-reading sources and updating themes/bets, transfer to
  `triage_pipeline` (one full pass).
- When asked to "watch", "keep monitoring", or run "continuously", transfer to
  `watch_loop` (up to 3 passes, stops early when nothing new).

Directives are the user's declarative intent. If a user statement sounds like a
new standing order (contains "always", "from now on", "whenever"), tell them to
add it on the Directives page — you cannot create directives yourself.

Dispatching code fixes — when the user asks you to FIX something in code (or
the `fix-from-feedback` skill applies): call `list_handoffs` first; if no open
handoff covers the problem, call `create_handoff` ONCE with the bet's problem
statement, its fb_ evidence_ids, and concrete testable acceptance criteria
(e.g. "business plan with 12 seats returns HTTP 200"). Then transfer to
`coder`, ALWAYS stating the handoff id explicitly in your message to it —
"Work handoff hf_… to completion" (the coder also reads session state key
"handoff_id" when a caller sets it, but the id in the message is the channel
that always works). The coder edits only files under workspace/, proves the
fix by running the workspace test suite, closes the handoff, and records its
own "code_fix" action — never record one on its behalf."""
